# INIA

++Machine learning:++
Programming computers to __optimize a performance criterion__ using __example data or past experience__.

Learning used when:
- humans expertise does not exist (navigating on Mars)
- humans are unable to explain their expertise (speech recognition)
- solutions changes in time (routing on a computer network)
- solution needs to be adapted to particular cases (user biometrics)

++Supervised methods:++
learning a **function** that **maps** an **input** (features) to an **output** (target
or labels) based on **examples input-output pairs**.

- discrete output values -> classification
- continuous output values -> regression
